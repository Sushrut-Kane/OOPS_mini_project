# Caffé Elegante – OOP-Based Café Management System

Caffé Elegante is a simple desktop-based café management system built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The goal of this project was to design a structured and modular system that handles basic operations of a café, including order placement, billing, and menu handling.

This project was created as part of a mini project to demonstrate the practical application of OOP principles.

## Features

- Display café menu with item names and prices
- Take customer orders
- Calculate total bill based on selected items
- Generate basic receipts or summaries
- Menu-driven interface in the terminal

## Concepts Used

- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance (if applicable)
- Polymorphism (if applicable)
- File handling (if included)

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C++
- Environment: Desktop terminal (command line interface)

## Folder Structure

```bash
OOPS_mini_project/
├── main.cpp              # Main logic for the café system
├── menu.txt (optional)   # Stores café menu items and prices
├── receipt.txt (optional)# Stores receipt logs
└── README.md
How to run it locally?
git clone https://github.com/Sushrut-Kane/OOPS_mini_project.git
cd OOPS_mini_project
g++ main.cpp -o cafe
./cafe
Note* This is a standalone offline project meant for learning and demonstrating good code structure using OOP. Improvements like GUI, database integration, or real-time order tracking can be considered for future versions.
